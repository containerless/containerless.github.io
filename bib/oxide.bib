Strong and chemically homogeneous precursor fibers of 5--40&#xa0;μm diameter were made at rates of up to 1·6&#xa0;m s−1 by glass fiber pulling techniques from undercooled molten oxides. The precursor fibers were heat treated at temperatures up to 1873&#xa0;K to make crystalline fibers with controlled grain size and properties. Tensile strengths of the precursor fibers were up to 5--6&#xa0;GPa (900&#xa0;ksi) for YAG- (Y3Al5O12) and mullite- (Al6Si2O13) compositions. Research to optimize fiber compositions and crystallization processes, and to scale up precursor fiber production is discussed.},

	Abstract = {Drop solution calorimetry was used to determine the enthalpy of solution in lead borate for three different materials with the chemical composition Y3Al5O12. Crystalline yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG), a crystalline mixture of 3 YAlO3 (perovskite) plus Al2O3 (α-alumina), and a glass, were all synthesized by containerless melting and cooling. The enthalpies of drop-dissolution per mole of Y3Al5O12 were 472.49&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;4.19, 440.35&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;3.59, and 196.02&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;3.39 kJ/mol, respectively, for the garnet, the crystalline mixture, and the glass. The garnet phase is thermodynamically stable with respect to the corresponding mixture of α-alumina and perovskite confirming that the two phase mixture is metastable. The enthalpy of vitrification of YAG is 276.47&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;5.40 kJ/mol (13.82&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;0.27 kJ/g atom). This high value for the enthalpy of vitrification is related to the reluctant glass forming ability of the YAG composition. The heat of fusion of Y3Al2O12 is estimated to be 25.8 kJ/g atom or 516 kJ/mol at its melting point, 2240 K.},

	Abstract = {We report formation of single- and two-phase glasses from rare-earth oxide--alumina materials. Liquids with the Y3Al5O12 and Er3Al5O12 compositions underwent a liquid--liquid phase transition which resulted in glasses with a cloudy appearance due to spheroids of one glass in a matrix of a second glass. The two glasses were isocompositional within the limits of experimental error. Clear, brilliant, single-phase glasses were obtained from La3Al5O12, ErLaYAl5O12, and compositions containing ≥5 mol% La2O3 substituted for the other rare-earth oxides. Formation of two glasses is attributed to nucleation and growth of the second liquid at a temperature below the equilibrium liquid--liquid transition temperature. Addition of lanthanum depresses the phase transition temperature below the glass transition temperature and the liquid--liquid phase transition is not observed. The results are discussed in the context of first-order liquid--liquid phase transitions (polyamorphism) and formation of single-phase glass from liquids that contain a high proportion of 4-coordinate aluminum ions.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT ABSTRACTRare-earth-aluminum oxide-composition glass fibers 5-50 μm in diameter and containing up to 50 mole % rare-earth oxide were drawn from undercooled liquids 550-650 K below the equilibrium melting point. The fibers have tensile strengths of ∼6 GPa, glass transition temperatures of ∼1150 K, and infrared transmission up to ∼5500 nm. The optical properties of erbium-doped fibers containing up to 12.5 mole % Er2O3 were investigated. The 1/e lifetime of the 4I13/2 excited state was 0.8-7 ms, decreasing with increasing Er concentration. Amplified spontaneous emission measurements indicate extremely broadband spectra, up to 135 nm (3-dB width) in 0.5 mole % fibers. Although this result is encouraging, the gain bandwidth, which has not been measured, is likely narrower. Glass fibers were crystallized by heat treatment under tension at temperatures of 1300-1900 K to form flexible, creep resistant polycrystalline monofilaments with tensile strengths up to 2.4 GPa. },

	Abstract = {Five Nd--aluminosilicate glasses along the 2NdAlO 3 --3SiO 2 join were synthesized using conventional drop-quench techniques. A sixth glass, with the end-member NdAlO 3 composition, required synthesis by containerless liquid-phase processing methods to avoid crystallization. Enthalpies of drop solution (Δ H ds ) and formation (Δ H f ) for the Nd--aluminosilicate glasses and the NdAlO 3 -composition end-member glass were measured in molten 2PbO--B 2 O 3 at 1078 K in a twin Calvet type calorimeter. Values for Δ H ds for the Nd--aluminosilicate glasses increase with decreasing silica content from 130.7 $\pm$ 1.5 to 149.6 $\pm$ 0.6 kJ mol −1 . Similarly, values of Δ H f increase with decreasing silica content from 41.0 $\pm$ 2.0 to 59.0 $\pm$ 1.6 kJ mol −1 . Values of Δ H ds and Δ H f for NdAlO 3 -composition glass were measured as 99.3 $\pm$ 0.9 and 139.2 $\pm$ 2.1 kJ mol −1 , respectively. Using transposed temperature drop calorimetry, the enthalpy of vitrification for NdAlO 3 -composition glass was measured as 69.5 $\pm$ 0.9 kJ mol −1 relative to the stable crystalline neodymium aluminium perovskite (NdAlO 3 ) phase. Enthalpies of mixing were calculated based on amorphous end members; the strongly negative values support the absence of immiscibility in this system. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to determine glass transition ( T g ) and crystallization ( T x ) temperatures, as well as values for the configurational heat capacity (Δ C P ( T g )) and the temperature range of the supercooled liquid interval (Δ T ( SCL )). The NdAlO 3 -composition glass showed no evidence of a glass transition prior to crystallization; only a single exotherm was observed, the onset of which occurred at 1045 K. For the Nd--aluminosilicates, values of T g and Δ T ( SCL ) increase with increasing silica content, from 1128 to 1139 K and from ~95 to ~175 K, respectively. Values of (Δ C P ( T g )) increase with decreasing silica content, from ~27 to ~75 J/g fw ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lowast.gif] {lowast} K, reflecting the increasing fragility and decreasing stability of the liquids as the end member composition, NdAlO 3 , is approached.},

@article{Wilding2004281,
	Abstract = {Combined neutron and X-ray diffraction data show changes in the structure of magnesium silicate glasses, ranging in composition from enstatite (MgSiO3) to forsterite (Mg2SiO4). The most abrupt change occurs in the narrow compositional range 38% SiO2 to 33% SiO2 (Mg2SiO4). These structural changes reflect a change from a glass characterized by corner shared SiO4 tetrahedra and an approximately equal mixture of MgO4 and MgO5 polyhedra, to one in which the average coordination of magnesium by oxygen is increased from 4.5$\pm$0.1 to 5.0$\pm$0.1. Both these local environments are very different from that of their crystalline counterparts. Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) simulation fits to the experimental neutron, and X-ray diffraction data have been performed to extract the partial radial distribution functions for the enstatite and forsterite glasses. The structural changes are interpreted as a change in the underlying configurational landscape and are considered to be a manifestation of similar structural changes in the stable liquid. These configurational changes are associated with a discontinuous change in the rheological properties of these glass-forming liquids close to the forsterite composition and suggest differences in the transport properties of magnesium silicate liquids at high pressure. Preliminary data on compressed magnesium silicate glasses indicates that higher coordinate Mg--O is expected to be more stable with increasing pressure.},

	Abstract = {Inorganic glasses normally exhibit a network of interconnected, covalent-bonded, structural elements that has no long-range order. In silicate glasses, the network formers are based on SiO4 tetrahedra interconnected through oxygen atoms at the corners. Conventional wisdom implies that alkaline and alkaline-earth orthosilicate materials cannot be vitrified, because they do not contain sufficient network-forming SiO2 to establish the needed interconnectivity. We studied a bulk magnesium orthosilicate glass obtained by containerless melting and cooling. We found that the role of network former was largely taken on by corner and edge sharing of highly distorted, ionic Mg-O species that adopt 4-, 5-, and 6-coordination with oxygen. The results suggest that similar glassy phases may be found in the containerless environment of interstellar space.},

	Abstract = { Yttria−alumina (YA) glasses containing 59.8−75.6 mol % Al2O3 were synthesized in the form of 1−3.5 mm diameter spheroids using containerless techniques. The glasses formed at cooling rates ranging from <70 K/s at compositions near 72 mol % Al2O3 and up to 300 K/s at the ends of the composition range. Samples with compositions from 59.8 to ∼69.0 mol % Al2O3 contained two glass phases, with an immiscible droplet (∼1−20 μm diameter) phase in the matrix glass. A single glass phase was formed at greater alumina concentrations. Glasses near the alumina- and yttria-rich ends of the compositional suite also contained ∼5−20% and 1−2% crystals, respectively. Heat capacities (CP) of the glasses and supercooled liquids, glass transition temperatures (Tg), configurational heat capacities at Tg (ΔCP(Tg)), and glass structures were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy. The Tg increases slightly with alumina content, from 1146 to 1156 K. The Cp increases ∼60% at Tg to form a highly fragile supercooled liquid. The concentrations of 4-, 5-, and 6-coordinate Al3+ ions in a single-phase glass with 71.5 mol % Al2O3 (Y71.5A) are ∼68% $\pm$ 4, 27% $\pm$ 3, and 6% $\pm$ 2, respectively. A minimum 6- and maximum 5-coordinate Al3+ concentration occurs near the Y71.5A composition, which is one of the best glass formers. In the context of the structural and thermodynamic properties reported herein, the formation mechanism and coordination of polyamorphic YA glasses are discussed. },

@article{YeganehHaeri1998200,
	Abstract = {Sound wave velocities have been measured for CaAl2O4 glass and for two compositions along the Y2O3--Al2O3 join by Brillouin scattering spectroscopy. The sound speeds in these aluminate glasses range from 6.96&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;0.16 km/s (vL) and 3.81&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;0.05 km/s (vT). The corresponding bulk moduli are K=79 GPa for CaAl2O4 glass, and 113&#xa0;$\pm$&#xa0;5 GPa for the Y2O3--Al2O3 glasses. The latter moduli are much larger than for most silicate or aluminosilicate glasses. The low compressibility is due to the lack of traditional network-forming cations in the yttrium aluminate glass so that all Al--O and Y--O bonds contribute equally in resisting compression.},

@article{JACE:JACE577,
	Abstract = {Solidification of aluminum oxide from undercooled melts was investigated in containerless experiments. Specimens were levitated in a gas jet, stabilized with an acoustic positioning device, and melted with cw CO2 laser beams. Cooling curves were obtained by optical pyrometry when the laser intensity was reduced. The materials examined were high-purity Verneuil sapphire, 99.5% polycrystalline alumina, and oxide materials recovered from the effluent of an aluminum-fueled rocket motor. The degree of undercooling, the apparent temperature behavior during the thermal arrest on solidification, and the structure of the materials formed were different in argon and oxygen atmospheres. Undercooling of the sapphire and alumina materials was 360 $\pm$ 10 K in an oxygen atmosphere and approximately 450 K in argon. Melting and solidification of high-purity sapphire resulted in a dendritic and porous polycrystalline material in oxygen. Dense, larger crystals were obtained in argon. Products formed from 99.5% alumina were discolored and the cores were white, indicating impurity segregation effects. More reproducible behavior was observed for the sapphire and 99.5% alumina than for the tungstencontaminated rocket motor effluent materials.},

	Abstract = {Glass formation from melts of 44 CaO 56Ga2O3(mol%) was investigated under containerless conditions obtained by acoustically stabilized aerodynamic levitation in combination with laser beam heating. The critical cooling rate for glass formation was Rc<100$\,^{\circ}$C/s, much less than values reported in the literature (Rc=550o$\pm$120o C/s and ca 350oC/s) for pendant drops of this composition attached to Pt-Rh thermocouples. High values of Rc in pendant drop experiments were confirmed for the specimens used in this work.},
