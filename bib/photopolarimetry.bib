	Abstract = {Spectroscopic ellipsometric (SE) measurements obtained using the grating division-of-amplitude photopolarimeter (G-DOAP) are presented. G-DOAP measures all four Stokes parameters of arbitrarily polarized light over the full spectrum (550--940 nm in the present case), with no moving parts or modulators in less than 1 s. It serves as the reflected-light polarization analyzer of an SE system in which the incident polarization state is fixed, thus facilitating time-resolved SE measurements. SE measurements were performed on silicon wafers with a single oxide layer over a range of incidence angles, incident linear polarization azimuths and oxide-film thicknesses. Methods used to analyze the SE data in the presence of apparent depolarization by thick-oxide wafers are presented.},

	Abstract = {The grating division-of-amplitude photopolarimeter (G-DOAP) is an instrument that exploits the multiple-beam-splitting, polarizing, and dispersive properties of diffraction gratings for the time-resolved measurement of the complete state of polarization of collimated broadband incident light, as represented by the four Stokes parameters as a function of wavelength across the spectrum. It is a compact, high-speed sensor that has no moving parts and is simple to install and operate. These characteristics make the G-DOAP well suited for in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) applications for monitoring and controlling thin-film processes. The design and performance of a prototype instrument are presented. Precise SE measurements, to {\textpm}0.04{\textdegree} in $\psi$ and {\textpm}0.1{\textdegree} in $\Delta$, are demonstrated in the 550--940-nm wavelength range.},

	Abstract = { Abstract Automated Mueller-matrix ellipsometry was used to investigate the optical properties of electroformed standard rough surfaces as a function of r.m.s. surface roughness heights and angle of incidence. The r.m.s. roughness of the specimens examined varied from 50 to 12 500 nm. Six different surface finishes and 22 different specimens were examined and Mueller matrices were obtained at angles of incidence that varied from 30 to 80$\,^{\circ}$. Measurements were conducted at a wavelength of 633 nm with the use of a division-of-amplitude photopolarimeter capable of simultaneously measuring all four Stokes parameters of arbitrarily polarized light. Values of ψ and Δ, the ellipsometric parameters, were derived from the measured Mueller matrices. The results demonstrate firstly the monotonic variations in the derived values of Δ with surface roughness for fixed angles of incidence, which include a `resonance' effect for specimens with r.m.s. roughness heights close to the wavelength of light, secondly a systematic variation of ψ with the angle of incidence for different specimen roughness values and a reversal in these trends beyond the pseudo-Brewster angle, thirdly a monotonic variation in Δ values with the angle of incidence for different roughness values, fourthly relatively large variations in ψ values for roughness values close to the wavelength of light and fifthly relatively little change in ψ and Δ values for roughness values that greatly exceeded the wavelength of light. },

@article{Krishnan:94,
	Abstract = {A fully automated Mueller-matrix ellipsometer with a division-of-amplitude photopolarimeter as the polarization-state detector is described. This device achieves Mueller-matrix ellipsometry by measuring the Stokes parameters of reflected light as a function of the fast axis C of a quarter-wave retarder, which, in combination with a fixed linear polarizer, determines the polarization state of incident light. The reflected Stokes parameters were Fourier analyzed to give the 16 elements of the Mueller matrix. We investigated depolarization of polarized light on reflection from rough, heterogeneous, and anisotropic surfaces by obtaining measurements on rolled aluminum and plant leaves. The results demonstrate (1) a variation of degree of polarization of reflected light with the input polarization state, (2) the precision with which the measured matrices describe the depolarization results, (3) effects of surface anisotropy (rolling direction) on depolarization and cross polarization by reflection from aluminum surfaces, and (4) large values and differences in the depolarization effects from conifer and deciduous leaves. Depolarization of light reflected by the aluminum surfaces was most sensitive to the angle between the plane of incidence and the rolling direction when the incident Stokes parameters S1, S2, and S3 were equal.},
