	Abstract = {Containerless liquid-phase processing methods were used to synthesize two glasses, both containing alumina (A), yttria (Y), and lanthana (L), and one containing ∼20 mole% silica (S) as well. In both materials, denoted AYL and AYLS, alumina is the dominant component (>50 mole%), and the lanthana:yttria ratio is ∼2:1. A variety of experimental techniques, e.g. X-ray diffraction, high-field 27Al magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR), differential scanning calorimetry, and neutron diffraction, were used to analyze both the structure of the amorphous phases resulting from liquid-phase processing and subsequent thermal treatments, and the thermodynamic properties of the as-made and heat-treated materials. The results of the experiments on these glasses and liquids have elucidated the nature of the transitions occurring between the glass transition and crystalline regimes, and have enabled the synthesis of a novel class of alumina-based nanomaterials.},

	Abstract = {Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) and microscopy demonstrate that the ∼1400$\,^{\circ}$C oxidation of levitated droplets of a natural Fe2+-bearing aluminosilicate (basalt) melt occurs by chemical diffusion of Fe2+ and Ca2+ to the free surface of the droplet; internal oxidation of the melt results from the required counterflux of electron holes. Diffusion of an oxygen species is not required. Oxidation causes the droplets to go subsolidus; magnetite (Fe3O4) forms at the oxidation-solidification front with a morphology suggestive of a Liesegang-band nucleation process.},

@article{CambridgeJournals:8161548,
	Abstract = { ABSTRACT Verneuil sapphire was purified of Cr3+ by containerless melting and processing at ca. 2550 K in argon, dry air, and pure oxygen. Recovered material was examined by laser induced fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy. The Cr3+ fluorescence intensity decreased in processed specimens at rates proportional to the chromium concentration and p(O2)0.21. The initial chromium concentration was ca. 5 ppm and decreased by factors of ca. 50, 3000, and 2 × 105 after processing for 300 s in argon, air, and oxygen, respectively. Evidence is presented that the Cr3+ was removed predominantly as CrO2(g) and not by conversion to other oxidation states of chromium in the condensed phase. },
