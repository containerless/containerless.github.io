	Abstract = {Preparation and field-emission characteristics of silicon tips coated by diamond particles are described. The particles grew by a hot-filament CVD process preferentially on the very ends of the tips. An explanation is given for the preferential deposition based on the idea that the real temperature of the ends is markedly, about 200 $\,^{\circ}$C, greater than the average temperature of the tips. Field-emission measurements showed that diamond-coated silicon tips can give currents as large as 500 μA before they are destroyed, at least one order of magnitude larger than uncoated silicon tips. The temporal stability of the emission current was high.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT ABSTRACTChemically pure carbon fibers with small fiber diameters and high growth rates were obtained by laser assisted chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) using high reactor pressures and a unique rate control mechanism. Depending upon growth conditions and gases, these fibers were either flexible (elastic), brittle (thickened) or graphitic (strong). The elastic carbon fibers were uniform and appear to represent a novel form of carbon. The reactants were acetylene, ethylene or methane, and the reaction pressures ranged from 1.9 to 7.5 bar. The highest fiber growth rate was 0.33 mrn/s, and the lowest fiber diameter was 10 μm. },

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT Using high reactor pressures (>1 bar) and a unique rate control mechanism, three fibers were recently obtained by laser assisted chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) having elemental (i.e., boron, carbon, and silicon) compositions, small diameters (>9 μm), and surprisingly high growth rates (0.3--1.1 mm/s). By reacting silane and ammonia at high pressures (>1 bar) near the focus of a Nd-YAG laser beam, we have now obtained the first LCVD fibers with binary (i.e., silicon-nitrogen and silicon nitride) compositions having small diameters and high growth rates (0.34--0.74 mm/s). These fibers were amorphous. },

	Abstract = {By using high reactor pressures (&gt;1 bar) and a unique rate control mechanism, chemically pure and structurally uniform boron, carbon, silicon, silicon nitride and silicon carbide fibers were obtained by laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) with high growth rates (0·3--1·1 mm/s), high tensile strengths (up to 7·0 GPa) and small diameters (&gt;9 μm). The boron, carbon and silicon nitride fibers were amorphous, the silicon carbide fibers polycrystalline, and the silicon fibers either glassy, polycrystalline or single crystals. The latter were formed by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. The process speeds, and most likely the first-order process economics, are about the same as those reported for the commercial manufacture of single crystal sapphire fibers (which are, however, made by a different process). A commercial LCVD multifilament process is being developed. LCVD was also used to grow free-standing, three-dimensional microstructures (grids, springs, solenoids) directly from the vapor phase. Related microstructures (microwafers with VLS silicon bristles) are also becoming commercially available.},

	Abstract = {Using a unique fiber-growth control mechanism and high-reaction pressures (&gt;1 bar), silicon fibers were grown by laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition (LCVD) from silane near the focal point of a cw Nd:YAG laser beam. Fiber-growth rates ranged from &lt;1 to 500 µm/s and fiber tip temperatures from 525 to 1412$\,^{\circ}$ C. At low fibertip temperatures (&lt;600$\,^{\circ}$ C) silicon fibers yielding glassy fracture were obtained. Some crystallinity was observed by X-ray diffraction. Polycrystalline silicon fibers were formed at intermediate temperatures, single-crystal silicon fibers at high-laser intensities and high-tip temperatures. The single crystal LCVD silicon fibers were formed by a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism. Single-crystal VLS-LCVD silicon fibers were also obtained from liquid silicon-metal alloys by initiating fiber growth from the end of thin palladium, gold and platinum wires.},

	Abstract = {With laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition, strong and flexible carbon fibers were obtained at high reaction chamber pressures (> 1 bar) with growth rates > 0.3 millimeter per second; their tensile strength (3 gigapascals) approaches that of commercial intermediate modulus carbon fibers made by conventional process routes. With the process described here, carbon fibers can be produced with superior chemical purity and structural uniformity. They may become the material of choice in currently emerging premium end uses, including carbon fiber infrared detection elements.},
