	Abstract = {The atomic structures of liquid Si metal and SiGe alloy in the normal and supercooled liquid states have been measured by X-ray diffraction from aerodynamically levitated and laser heated liquid droplets. The measurements covered a wide range of scattering vector Q (0.8--20&#xa0;A−1) and a wide temperature range that extended into the supercooled region. The present results on liquid Si confirm earlier measurements that showed a decrease in first-shell coordination with increased supercooling. For liquid SiGe, the shoulder on the high-Q side of the first peak in the structure factor S(Q) sharpens with increased supercooling, suggesting an increase in covalent bonding and development of chemical short-range order.},

	Abstract = { We have made a new determination of the structure of liquid aluminum oxide over a wide temperature range, including the supercooled region, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Measurements were performed over a wide scattering vector range, 0.5−16 {\AA}-1. Specimens of aluminum oxide were aerodynamically levitated and laser-heated to temperatures in excess of the melting temperature of 2327 K. Diffraction measurements were performed in a temperature range of 2000−2600 K, which included the supercooled liquid state. Measurements performed in argon (reducing) and oxygen (oxidizing) atmospheres show little structural difference, in contrast to reported differences in optical properties. The X-ray results are in excellent agreement with those of a molecular dynamics simulation performed with an ab initio interaction potential. },

Measurements were made on laser beam-heated liquids at 2000--2100 K held in an aerodynamic levitator. Pure vanadium levitation nozzles were used. Reduction of the nozzle wall thickness decreased attenuation of scattered neutrons to give a two-fold increase in signal intensity. The liquids are comprised of predominantly 4-coordinated aluminum and 6- and higher-coordinated group II metal ions. },

@article{JACE:JACE2777,
	Abstract = {We report the first measurements of the structure factor, S(Q), and the pair distribution function, G(r), of Al6Si2O13 (3:2 mullite) in the normal and supercooled liquid states in the temperature range 1776--2203 K. Measurements are obtained by synchrotron X-ray scattering on levitated, laser-heated liquid specimens. The S(Q) shows a prepeak at 2.0 {\AA}−1 followed by a main peak at 4.5 {\AA}−1 and a weak feature at 8 {\AA}−1. The G(r) shows a strong (Si,Al)--O correlation at 1.80 {\AA} at high temperature that moves to 1.72 {\AA} as the liquid is supercooled. The second and third nearest neighbor peaks at 3.0 and 4.25 {\AA} sharpen with supercooling. The short-range structure of the high-temperature liquid is similar to the corresponding glasses produced by rapid quenching. Supercooling causes an increase in the concentration of tetrahedral Si4+ ions, which is manifested by the large shift in the first peak to lower ionic distance, r, values in G(r). The increase in tetrahedrally coordinated Si4+ ions is offset by an increase in octahedral Al3+ ions. The clustering of the SiO44− tetrahedral units results in increased viscosity of the liquid at temperatures below the melting point, which is consistent with Al6Si2O13 being a fragile liquid.},

	Abstract = {Recent measurements of the atomic structure of supercooled liquid B, Ni, Si and Zr show a short-range structure similar to that of the nucleating crystalline phases. As the liquids are supercooled, the coordination numbers and interatomic distances increase, decrease or remain essentially constant to approach the values characteristic of the crystals that nucleate from the liquid. Further support for the present observations comes from prior results on Ga, Ge and Pd. This observed correlation between supercooled liquid and crystalline structures provides new insight into nucleation phenomena. The trends in the experimental results and the relationship between the short-range structural properties of supercooled elemental liquids and their crystalline counterparts are discussed.},
